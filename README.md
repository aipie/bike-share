🚴‍♂️ Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis
Understanding Differences Between Annual Members and Casual Riders

📌 Project Overview
Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, aims to convert casual riders into annual members by understanding their ride patterns. This project analyzes how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently using a dataset of ride records.

🎯 North Star Metric
The primary success metric for this analysis is:
"Increase the conversion rate of casual riders to annual members."

🔍 Key Dimensions Explored
Ride Duration & Distance – Do casual riders take longer rides than members?
Time of Day & Week – When do casual riders ride compared to members?
Rideable Type Preferences – Are casual riders more likely to use electric bikes?
Seasonal Trends – How do patterns change across months?
Ride Start Locations – Do casual riders use bikes for tourism, while members use them for commuting?

📊 Key Findings
Casual riders take longer rides on average compared to annual members.
Casual riders frequently use electric bikes, while members prefer classic bikes.
Casual rides peak on weekends and afternoons, while members ride more on weekdays and during rush hours.
Casual rides tend to start in tourist-heavy areas, while members often start in residential or business districts.

🏆 Recommendations
Introduce time-based promotions (e.g., discounted weekday rides for casual users).
Encourage membership sign-ups at peak casual usage points (e.g., popular ride start locations).
Offer incentives for classic bike usage to optimize fleet costs.
Targeted marketing campaigns promoting the benefits of membership based on user behavior.

🚀 Next Steps
Deeper analysis of ride start-end locations to segment casual users further.
Predictive modeling to forecast which casual riders are likely to convert to members.
A/B testing of marketing strategies to measure effectiveness.
