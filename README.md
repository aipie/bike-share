# Project Background
Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago, with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Most cyclistic users are likely to ride for leisure, but 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day. Cyclistic has concluded that while flexible pricing attracts more customers, annual members are more profitable. This project analyses trip data to uncover patterns between casual riders and members that can be used to increase membership conversion among casual riders. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

1. Comparative Trip Frequency and Usage Intensity: Direct comparison of trip frequency, trip duration, and trip distance between casual and member riders
2. Temporal Usage Analysis: Comparing time-based usage patterns, including peak hours, days of the week, and seasonal trends.
3. Spacial Usage Analysis: Analysing and comparing station usage, popular routes, and destinations between casual and member riders.
4. Usage Pattern Variations: Examining the notable differences between casual and member usage patterns and inferring potential triggers for membership conversion.

#Executive Summary
Overview of Findings
Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.
